In my previous org, we followed a microservices-based architecture hosted on AWS. The services were independently deployable and built using Node.js and Python. We used API Gateway to manage incoming requests, routed to the appropriate microservices running on ECS Fargate. For synchronous processing, we used SQS and SNS for tasks like sending emails, notifications, and processing large data sets. Our databases were split by service, using RDS, PostgreSQL, and DynamoDB. For CICD, we used GitHub Actions and GitLab, and for infrastructure automation, we used Terraform. For monitoring, we used CloudWatch and custom dashboards for alert metrics. We also used Secrets Manager for secret handling.
