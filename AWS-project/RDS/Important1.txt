Amazon RDS Interview Q&A (Notepad Version)

1. What is Amazon RDS and why is it used?
Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) is a managed service by AWS that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale relational databases in the cloud.
It automates tasks like provisioning, patching, backup, recovery, and scaling — allowing teams to focus on application logic instead of database administration.

2. What are the supported database engines in RDS?
RDS supports six main database engines:

Amazon Aurora (MySQL/PostgreSQL compatible)

MySQL

PostgreSQL

MariaDB

Oracle

Microsoft SQL Server

3. What is the difference between RDS and a database running on EC2?

RDS: Fully managed by AWS (automated backups, patching, HA, scaling).

EC2 Database: You install and manage everything manually — OS, patches, backups, scaling, and replication.
In short, RDS = managed service; EC2 = self-managed database.

4. What is Multi-AZ deployment in RDS and why is it important?
Multi-AZ creates a synchronous standby replica of your database in another Availability Zone.
It ensures high availability and automatic failover in case the primary DB or AZ fails.
Used mainly for disaster recovery and business continuity, not for read scaling.

5. What are Read Replicas, and how are they different from Multi-AZ?
Read Replicas are asynchronous copies of your primary DB used for read scaling (e.g., handling heavy read traffic).

Multi-AZ: Used for high availability (standby, no direct reads).

Read Replica: Used for performance scaling (active read traffic).

6. How does RDS handle backups?
RDS supports automated backups and manual snapshots.
Automated backups are taken daily during the backup window and stored in S3.
Transaction logs are also backed up every 5 minutes for point-in-time recovery.

7. What is the difference between automated backups and manual snapshots?

Automated Backups: Created automatically by RDS, retained for a configurable period (1–35 days). Deleted when instance is deleted.

Manual Snapshots: Created manually by the user, retained indefinitely until deleted.

8. How do you enable high availability in RDS?
By deploying the instance in Multi-AZ mode.
RDS automatically provisions a standby replica in another AZ and performs automatic failover during outages.

9. Can you encrypt data in RDS? How?
Yes. You can enable encryption at rest using AWS KMS when creating the RDS instance.
Data in transit can also be encrypted using SSL/TLS connections.
Encryption cannot be enabled later — you must create a new encrypted copy if needed.

10. What are some ways to improve RDS performance?

Use Read Replicas for read-heavy workloads.

Choose appropriate instance types and storage (IOPS).

Optimize indexes and queries.

Enable Performance Insights for monitoring.

Tune DB parameter groups for better caching and memory management.

11. What are DB parameter groups and option groups in RDS?

Parameter Group: Controls DB engine configuration settings (like max_connections, innodb_buffer_pool_size).

Option Group: Enables additional features like Oracle TDE or SQL Server audit.
Together, they help customize and extend database functionality.

12. How does scaling work in RDS (vertical vs horizontal)?

Vertical Scaling: Increasing instance size (CPU, memory, IOPS).

Horizontal Scaling: Adding Read Replicas to distribute read traffic.
RDS supports both, but write scaling usually needs vertical scaling.

13. What is the maximum storage size supported by RDS?
It varies by engine:

Up to 128 TiB for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB.

Up to 64 TiB for SQL Server.

Up to 128 TiB for Amazon Aurora.

14. How can you secure your RDS instance?

Place RDS inside a VPC private subnet.

Use security groups and network ACLs.

Enable encryption (KMS).

Enforce IAM authentication and SSL.

Restrict public access and manage access using parameter groups and least-privilege principles.

15. How does RDS integrate with VPC and security groups?
RDS instances are launched inside a VPC, allowing control over networking using subnets and route tables.
Security groups act as virtual firewalls, controlling inbound and outbound traffic to your RDS instance.

16. What is the difference between storage types (General Purpose SSD, Provisioned IOPS, Magnetic) in RDS?

General Purpose SSD (gp3/gp2): Balanced performance, cost-effective.

Provisioned IOPS (io1/io2): High performance for IO-intensive workloads (OLTP).

Magnetic: Legacy, slower, cheaper (rarely used now).

17. Can you stop and start an RDS instance? What are the limitations?
Yes, you can stop/start RDS instances except Aurora.
Limitations:

You can stop it for up to 7 days, after which it auto-starts.

Billing for storage continues even when stopped.

Multi-AZ and cluster configurations have restrictions.

18. What is Amazon Aurora and how is it different from standard RDS engines?
Amazon Aurora is a cloud-native, high-performance database compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL.
Differences:

Up to 5× faster than MySQL and 3× faster than PostgreSQL.

Automatically replicates data 6 times across 3 AZs.

Supports auto-scaling storage up to 128 TiB.

Offers serverless and global database options.

19. How do you migrate an on-premises database to RDS?
You can use:

AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) – minimal downtime migration.

AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT) – for heterogeneous migrations.

Backup and Restore or Export/Import depending on DB engine.

20. What happens during a maintenance window in RDS?
During the maintenance window, AWS applies patches, updates, and minor version upgrades.
If Multi-AZ is enabled, failover occurs to minimize downtime.
If not, you might experience a short interruption while maintenance completes.
