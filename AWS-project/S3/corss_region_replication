S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) is used to automatically replicate objects from one S3 bucket to another bucket in a different AWS Region, which helps with disaster recovery, latency optimization, and compliance requirements.

In one of my projects, we implemented CRR to replicate static assets from our primary bucket in ap-south-1 (Mumbai) to a backup bucket in us-east-1 (N. Virginia) for global content delivery and redundancy.

The setup involves enabling versioning on both buckets, creating an IAM role for replication, and defining a replication rule in the source bucket.

Both buckets should be private and Versioning enabled required on both buckets.
Encryption at rest can be enforced using SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, or SSE-C
In S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR), the source bucket needs an IAM role that S3 can assume to perform replication on our behalf.
That IAM role must have permissions to read from the source bucket and write to the destination bucket.
On the destination bucket, we must create a bucket policy that explicitly allows that IAM role from the source account to write data into it.
To replicate existing objects, use S3 Batch Replication, which copies pre-existing data one time.

Use S3 Replication Metrics and Replication Time Control (RTC) to monitor replication status.

RTC guarantees replication within 15 minutes, and metrics can be viewed in CloudWatch.

You can also use the S3 console → Management → Replication → Metrics tab

Delete marker replication: disabled
when we delete any file from source bucket then delete marker added in source bucket A.
In this case data still vailable in destination bucket.

Delete marker replication: Enabled.
this behaviour will delete the objects from both buckets.
  used when we want complete synchronization.
