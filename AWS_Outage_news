AWS (US-EAST-1) DynamoDB Outage report explained in plain English.

1. A race condition in DynamoDBâ€™s DNS automation deleted its main endpoint record.

2. This happened when 2 DNS systems updated Route 53 at the same time and removed all IPs.

3. DynamoDB went offline, and services that depend on it like EC2, Lambda, Redshift, and IAM stopped working.

4. EC2 could not launch new instances because it uses DynamoDB to track server state.

5. Network and Load Balancer systems failed next, causing connection errors across AWS.

6. Engineers fixed the DNS issue, full recovery took about 15 hours.

If you are a DevOps or Cloud Engineer, this is a great use case to understand. 

A small DNS automation glitch can bring half the internet down.
