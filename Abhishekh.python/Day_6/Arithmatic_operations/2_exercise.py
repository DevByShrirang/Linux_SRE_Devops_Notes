#Resource usage percentage

used = 50
total = 200
percent = (used / total) * 100


print("usage:",percent, "%")


# Arithmetic here is supportive logic for automation, not the main goal.
# In DevOps, you’ll use math to:
# Calculate usage %
# Add counters
# Compare metrics (e.g., CPU > 80%)
# Do simple averages or cost multiplications
# So even basic arithmetic, used smartly, is enough.
