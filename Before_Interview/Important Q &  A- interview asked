Intro?
what is egress and ingress ?
there is an ec2 i want to create what areiput parametrs will you consider while creating ec2 by using terraform?
will you create new SG of use existing one ?
write terraform script Ec2 instance,ebs, and attach ec2 to EBS.
what is authorization in IAM ?
there are two accouns ac1 and ac2 how you wil connect with each other to access the resources? I said IAM role with assume the role in account1
You have an EBS volume of type gp3 attached to your EC2 instance, and now you want to change it to io1.
How will you do that?
Will it create a new volume, or will your data remain as it is?
what is subnets?
there is an ingress which is not routing correctly how will troubleshoot it in ingress?

Intro
there is an java app i want deploy it on ec2 without docker and kubertes how will you setup jenkins ci cd for that?
now i want to deploy it via docker without k8s how will you setup jenkins ci cd for that?
now i want to deploy 20 microservices with helps of docker how will you setup jenkins ci cd for that? how will you make communication between them?
now i want to deploy 20 microservices with help of k8s how will you setup jenkins ci cd for that? 
now i want to deploy 20 microservices with help of eks how will you setup jenkins ci cd for that?
as you mentioned earlier like you are writing separte pipeline for each microservice tommorow i hvae to write 10000 microservices shall i need to write seperate ci cd for the same 
or any option to avoid this?
where do you store config files in k8s ? --> i said k8s cluster configmap and secret in secret manager tool
what is blue green and canary deployment?
there is an nginx deplopment initially i use replicaset as 5 now i make it 15 but after apply it it running only 5 which existing one other one are not getting started 
how will you troubleshoot it ?
which monitoring tools are using ? what is efk ?
we have ec2 s3 rds which modules you are using what will be structure of that modules just give me overview?
what is git stash git status git squash?
what tearrform plan? terraform validate?

Intro 
what are the tools u r using 
could you explain your project
git fetch vs git pull
git rebase
branching strategy
git cherrypick

how you setup argo for multiple environment 
lets take in ci cd jenkins there is an sectret stored in secret manager when he is doing $something he gets a sectret in output which is not acceptable how you can fix it and what is 
drawbacks of this?

what is local exec and remote exec in terraform
what is file provisioner in terraform
what are the commands do you know in terraform
if i want run specific commands during creation of ec2 how can do that with or without terraform
if i by mistake deleted statefile not stored in remote backend no backups how can i get it back 

what pod distribution budget
there are two pods one is running in one ns1 and other in ns2 how you can make communication betn these two pods how you can check the commmunication betn them
eks version u r using 

what is the diffn betn replicaset and replication controller
s3 cores means
when we create LB what are the other componenets requred

Jenkins CI CD 
Jenkins CI CD stages 
How pipeline trigger automatically 
How the flow of u r CI CD 
What are the env are there 
I want to know the entire flow from dev to QA to preprod to prod 
What are issues u have faced while working on Jenkins
If Jenkins pipeline fails in build stage how you will trouble shoot?
Maven repo related scenarios questions?

Docker 

What Dockerfile
How do you write Dockerfile? 
What type of apps are there ?
How do you build an image?
If I have not mentioned cmd and entry point will it run docker file ?

If I don‚Äôt specify CMD or ENTRYPOINT in my Dockerfile, Docker will use whatever is defined in the base image.
If the base image doesn‚Äôt have either, the container will build but exit immediately because there‚Äôs no process to run.

For example, the ubuntu image works fine since it has /bin/bash as CMD, but if I use a minimal scratch image, it will fail since no command is defined.‚Äù


Kubernetes

What is kubernetes?
What is deployment?
What is the difference between service and ingress?
What is the difference between configmap and secrets?
How you will expose application on kubernetes?
What is pod ?
If we can store two containers in pod then what is use of second container?
In Kubernetes, a pod can run multiple containers when they need to work closely together.
The main container runs the core application, and the second (or sidecar) container adds support functions ‚Äî like log shipping, monitoring, proxying, or configuration management.
Both containers share the same network and volumes, which allows them to easily communicate and share data.
For example, I often use a sidecar container like Fluentd to collect logs from the main app container and push them to CloudWatch or Elasticsearch.‚Äù

Helm 

What is helm?
If I deployed application using helm version 1 and now I deploying new version that is helm 2 there is an issue with helm version 2 how will you solve this?
helm status my-app -n dev-ns   --> I will check application revision and status
helm history my-app -n dev-ns
helm list -n dev-ns
helm rollback my-app 1 -n dev-ns

lets take only cpu or memory realted data how kibana knows that he has take data from that.
Let's say. I nave deployed API in Kubernetes. And it is running database. Okay. so, What are all the components that are needed? F actively. Serve the request that is coming from outside lines
The API is running. The API is running in a Kubernetes cluster in a place.
Okay, so I am a client. I'm coming to you. I need To access that APA. Okay. So, you need to configure. Multiple things. For that. So that I will be able to access it because they is currently running in the AWS. That is a private. Your private VPC. I am a public user, I need to access it. So what are all the
So what are all the components that are needed that you need to configure? So that I will be A able to access your API.
A load balancer. You have created in that is AWS component. In Kubernetes You have created the increase of created the service
okay, so now you have created a service load balancer service When you create a Load Balancer service. So what will be created in the AWS side? There will be a lot.
Okay. Now let's say you have created a, what kind of Like in Route, 53 water. All the things, you will provide for that.
Okay. So, in DNS. so, In a Linux machine. Let's say you have a instance created. And you need that instance to use a particular DNS. So, how you will configure that?
yeah, there is a DNS server, let's say, you have you are hosting a DNS and you have a different DNS server and you have you need your PC to instance, to use your DNS server. How you will be able to achieve that? 
Okay, you have DNS server. You have created a DNS server. Okay, and you have created a easy to instance. That is a Linux instance: 80 you want your Linux instance to use the DNS server that you have created? For the name resolution. So, how you will achieve that?
Okay. Let's say you need to find a particular file. In a directory. How do you do that? What is the command?
So, how you will be able to filter out a single line? Using our command
If you put dollar one, Will it print? First. Line, or first column.
which is commnd to give as a single line out put from file
there are two files which contains 150 lines in one file and other file contain 200 lines how will find out that 50 different lines which not in file 1
