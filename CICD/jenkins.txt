what is discard old build

Jenkins keeps record of each build.
files  are getting generated by each build including log files and artifact.
This is useful if we want to review the hostory of job.
keeping more old build will cause disk space issue. so we can keep build only for certein period of time  keeping maximum number of build. so we ensure jenkins
agent will work healthy and without overload.
source code management allows you to interact with code stored in git repositroy. access of repository with credintials and selecting the perticular branch this 
features provided by source code management.

triggers mechanism in jenkins:-
Trigger build remotely- 
build after other projects are build
build pediodically
github hook trigger for GITScm polling
poll SCM

Trigger build remotely- Trigger build remotely allow jenkins jobs to be started by external system or scripts using an authentication token and URL endpoint.
                         its commonly used in automation pipelines or when integrating jenkins with other tools like ansible.

Build after other projects are build- This setup dependency chain. your job start automaticlly after another job finieshed successfully.
                           eg- once the build job finished successfully, the deployment job automatically starts.
                            eliminating the need for manual triggering.
build periodically- Build periodically allows you to run jenkins job on fixed time schedule ,
H/15 * * * * <-- job run every 15 minutes.
       we have used it for nighlty build, backup, automated reports generation.

Github hook trigger for GITscm polling- Github hook trigger uses webhooks so that jenkins is immeditely notified by github when a commit or pull request happens.
       this is best practice for ci/cd pipeline.

poll SCM- PollSCM makes jenkins to check Git repository periodicallly for changes. if its find new commit , it triggers new build utomatically.

cleanWS-  we have mentioned inside jenkins pipeline. used to programatically clean job the jobs workspace during the build. it gives fine control, we can call it
           before build, after deployment , or between stages to ensure clean environament.
delete workspace before build start-  This option available in jenkins job configuration, it helps you to clean workspace right before the build starts,
                                      delete all files in that job workspace before executing first build step.
