----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
we will expose only frontend to external using load balancer service.
every microservice manages its own data store. All services run in the same namespace for easier service discovery, and each Deployment can auto-scale using HPA based on traffic, ensuring high 
availability and resilience. 
Only the microservices that need to store stateful or business data require persistent storage — for example, services like checkout, payment, 
or product catalog that save orders, transactions, or product details.
1) checkoutservice has its own (MYSQL DB) for order details. product  catalog service stores product info in its own DB, and payment service has a (postgresSQl) backend for payment records.
other services cant query those database directly -they must use service API.--This ensures loose coupling, independent scaling, and fault isolation.
Many other services, such as frontend, email, recommendation, or ad services, are stateless — they don’t store data locally, so they don’t need persistent volumes.
