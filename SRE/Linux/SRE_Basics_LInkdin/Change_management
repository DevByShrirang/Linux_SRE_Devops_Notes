Change management - Is a controlling , communicating,and tracking changes to production system.
it’s about making changes safely, predictably, and transparently. 

Interview line:

“Most outages are caused by internal changes, not external failures — so in SRE, we design change management systems that ensure every change is visible, traceable, and reversible.”

“We replaced slow manual CABs with automated change records integrated into Slack, Jira, and Datadog — so every operator knows what changed, when, and by whom.

“Every automated deployment in our setup sends an event to Datadog and Slack. Operators can immediately correlate any performance spike with a specific release event — this drastically reduces MTTR.”
