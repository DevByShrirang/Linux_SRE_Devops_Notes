SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) is the practice of applying software engineering principles to IT operations and reliability.
Almost 80% of outages are self-inflicted.
     The majority of system outages or incidents are caused by human or internal changes.
            Most downtime comes from us — our own deployments, misconfigurations, patches, or rushed fixes.
        1) Code changes -  A buggy deployment pushed to production without enough testing.
        2) Configuration errors - wrong database endpoint ,bad yaml, or invalid environment variable
        3) Manual operations - someone restarted critical service , deletes a resources, or run a wrong command.
        4) Infrastruture updates - scaling, patching, or upgrading cluster that breaks compatibility.
        5) security or certificate issue - Expired SSL certificate or wrong IAM permissions revoking access.

**If an SSL certificate expires in production, HTTPS handshakes fail — users and APIs can’t establish secure connections,  resulting in service downtime.
Browsers will show security warnings, and backend services relying on TLS will start throwing handshake errors.
This can cause a full outage of the application layer.
In SRE practice, we prevent this by automating certificate renewal, monitoring expiration dates, and alerting well in advance to ensure reliability and compliance**

**SREs aim to reduce manual operations → every change must go through a release process instead of direct modification**
Core SRE release engineering principle
Automation first - Avoid manual CLI. use terraform IAC, jenkins, cicd
version control everything - All infra & application changes must be in git -enabling peer review, traceability, and rollback.
Repeatable, Tested Builds    --Build artifacts once, promote the same artifact through stages (Dev → QA → Prod).
Controlled Change Approval    --Use PR reviews and automated pipelines for change control instead of paperwork-heavy CABs.
Release Payload Clarity --Each release should have a well-defined payload — exactly what’s changing and why.
Canary / Blue-Green / Feature Flags --Deploy small, testable batches to limit blast radius and enable rollback.
Communication & Transparency Communicate changes automatically to internal and external stakeholders.
