ðŸ”¹ Simple Explanation of Linux Boot Process (Interview Style)

When I press the power button, the system begins with BIOS or UEFI, which is firmware stored on the motherboard.
BIOS/UEFI checks whether the basic hardware components â€” like CPU, RAM, keyboard, and disks â€” are working properly.
This check is called POST (Power-On Self-Test).
If POST passes, it means the hardware is healthy and ready to boot.
After that, BIOS/UEFI looks for a bootable device such as a hard drive, SSD, or USB â€” something that contains a valid bootloader.
The bootloader (like GRUB) is responsible for loading the Linux kernel and initramfs (initial RAM filesystem) into memory.
Once loaded:
The kernel initializes all the hardware and mounts the root filesystem.
It first uses initramfs temporarily until it switches to the real root filesystem.
Then the kernel starts systemd (process ID 1), which is the first process in Linux.
systemd starts all essential services â€” networking, logging, cron, etc. â€” based on configuration in /etc/systemd/system.
Finally, it starts the display manager (for GUI systems), which handles login and loads the user desktop environment.
