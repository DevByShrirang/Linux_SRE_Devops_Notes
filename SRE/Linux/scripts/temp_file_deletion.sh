    this bash script is used to check temporary directory. if present then it deletes files older than 10 minutes and log 
    the cleanup with timestamp to /var/log/cleanup_temp.log
    if the directory is not found this log also saved in log file.

4Ô∏è‚É£	Backup files/directories	tar, scp, timestamped filenames
5Ô∏è‚É£	Monitor and restart crashed app	ps, grep, kill, nohup
6Ô∏è‚É£	Parse a log file and extract errors	grep, awk, cut, sed
7Ô∏è‚É£	Check if a port is open	netstat, lsof, or nc
8Ô∏è‚É£	Loop through servers and run command	for loop, ssh, expect
9Ô∏è‚É£	API health check script (curl)	curl, response code check
