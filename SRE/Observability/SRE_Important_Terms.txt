SRE INTERVIEW TERMINOLOGY - COMPLETE REFERENCE

1. SLA (Service Level Agreement)
Formal commitment to customers about reliability or uptime (e.g., 99.9%). Business-level, may have penalties.

2. SLO (Service Level Objective)
Internal engineering target to maintain SLA (e.g., 99.95%). Defines acceptable reliability threshold.

3. SLI (Service Level Indicator)
Actual metric used to measure reliability (e.g., latency, error rate, availability).

4. Error Budget
Allowed failure = 100% - SLO. Balances reliability and release speed.

5. Toil
Manual, repetitive, automatable operational work that doesn’t scale. SRE goal: eliminate it via automation.

6. MTTR / MTBF / MTTA
MTTR – Mean Time to Recovery (restore service)
MTBF – Mean Time Between Failures
MTTA – Mean Time to Acknowledge (detect incident)

7. Incident / Outage / Postmortem
Incident – unplanned disruption
Postmortem – blameless review to identify root cause and prevention steps

8. Monitoring vs Alerting
Monitoring = observe metrics; Alerting = trigger action on threshold breach

9. Runbook / Playbook
Step-by-step guide to resolve known issues and reduce MTTR.

10. Blameless Postmortem
Root cause analysis without blaming individuals; focuses on process improvement.

11. Change Management
Safe deployment control using canary, blue-green, or feature flags.

12. Capacity Planning
Forecasting compute/network/storage needs to meet future load.

13. Blameless Culture
Encourages transparency and learning from failure instead of punishment.

14. Reliability vs Velocity
Balancing uptime (reliability) with release speed (velocity) using error budgets.

15. Auto-Remediation / Self-Healing
Automated recovery (restart pods, scale up nodes) without manual intervention.

16. Golden Signals
Four key user-facing metrics: Latency, Traffic, Errors, Saturation.

17. Error Budget Policy
Defines what to do when error budget is consumed (slow/freeze deploys).

18. Availability Calculation
Availability = (Total Time - Downtime) / Total Time * 100
99.9% = 43 min/month; 99.99% = 4.3 min/month.

19. Observability
Understanding why systems fail. Pillars: Metrics, Logs, Traces.

20. Chaos Engineering
Simulating controlled failures to test resilience (e.g., Gremlin, Chaos Mesh).

21. SLx Triangle Summary
SLI → Measures | SLO → Target | SLA → Commitment.

22. Service Health Dashboard
Visual display of SLOs, uptime, and incidents (Grafana, Dynatrace).

23. On-Call Rotation
24x7 operational support rotation among SREs.

24. Incident Severity (SEV Levels)
Categorizes impact: SEV1 = critical, SEV2 = major, SEV3 = minor.

25. Root Cause Analysis (RCA)
Detailed investigation of failure reasons.

26. Alert Fatigue
Too many non-actionable alerts; reduced attention to real incidents.

27. Error Budget Burn Rate
Rate at which reliability errors consume your error budget.

28. Release Freeze / Launch Freeze
Pause new deployments when reliability targets not met.

29. Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)
Average time to detect an issue after it occurs.

30. Service Ownership
Each SRE team owns reliability for its service end-to-end.

---
Summary:
SRE focuses on reliability via SLI/SLO/SLA, reducing toil, automation, observability, and blameless culture.
