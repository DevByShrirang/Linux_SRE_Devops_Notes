Understanding the k8 release:-
Kubernetes moves fast. Every few months, there’s a new release waiting to be tested and deployed. Teams often find themselves balancing upgrades
with daily operations. One delay turns into another, and before they know it, the version they run is nearing end of life. The pressure builds 
quietly.
Each release needs planning, testing, and coordination across tools and environments. It’s not the upgrades that tire teams, it’s the constant 
chase to keep everything in sync. Kubernetes follows semantic versioning. Each release has three parts: major, minor, and patch.
v1.34.1 --> here v1 is major version. .34 is a Minor version.  .1 is a patch version.

Major version:- Changes that may break existing APIs or setup.
Minor Version:- New features added without breaking what already works.
patch version: - small fixes or improvements to make things stable.

kubernetes runs predictable four month release cycle.
12 months of active support provided by kubernetes also  2 month of maintainance before it reaches end of life.
kubernetes follows 14-month support window. missing the window means running the version with no patches,no fixes,and no support.

1) Kube-apiserver- Always the highest version.(eg 1.34) - All other components should match or be one minor version lower..
2) controller manager/scheduler/cloud controller- can be one minor version lower than the API server.(v1.33 if API server is v1.34)
3) kubelet - can lag by one minor version.
4) Kubectl - can be one minor version ahead or behind the API server (works safely from v1.33 to v1.35 with v1.34)


How to Prepare for EOL (End of Life)
1) Track Your Current Version
Check your cluster version with kubectl version --short. Compare it against the Kubernetes Releases page to see when support ends.

2) Plan Two Upgrades Ahead
Always keep your cluster within two minor versions of the latest release. This avoids rushed, multi-version jumps later.

3) Use a Staging Cluster
Test upgrades in a non-production environment first. Validate workloads, controllers, and CRDs for compatibility.

4) Read Deprecation Notes
Review the “Deprecations and Removals” section in the release notes. Many breakages come from ignored API changes.

5)  Update Add-ons and Tools
Ensure CNI plugins, Ingress controllers, Helm charts, and monitoring tools match your target version.

6) Automate Upgrade Checks
Use tools like kubeadm upgrade plan or managed service dashboards (EKS, GKE, AKS) to schedule and track upgrade timelines.

7) Keeping upgrades small and steady makes EOL planning part of regular maintenance, not a last minute crisis.
